    "The lab material presented here is based on the data provided by the [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html) dataset that contains information on airports, airlines and routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html) dataset contains the ''Airport database'' that provides information for over 10,000 airports, train stations and ferry terminals spanning the globe. Each entry contains the following information:\n",
    "* **Airport ID** - Unique OpenFlights identifier for this airport.\n",
    "* **Name** - Name of airport. May or may not contain the City name.\n",
    "* **City** - Main city served by airport. May be spelled differently from Name.\n",
    "* **Country** - Country or territory where airport is located. See countries.dat to cross-reference to ISO 3166-1 codes.\n",
    "* **IATA** - 3-letter IATA code. Null if not assigned/unknown.\n",
    "* **ICAO** - 4-letter ICAO code. Null if not assigned.\n",
    "* **Latitude** - Decimal degrees, usually to six significant digits. Negative is South, positive is North.\n",
    "* **Longitude** - Decimal degrees, usually to six significant digits. Negative is West, positive is East.\n",
    "* **Altitude** - In feet.\n",
    "* **Timezone** - Hours offset from UTC. Fractional hours are expressed as decimals, eg. India is 5.5.\n",
    "* **DST** - Daylight savings time. One of E (Europe), A (US/Canada), S (South America), O (Australia), Z (New Zealand), N (None) or U (Unknown). See also: Help: Time\n",
    "* **Tz database time zone** - Timezone in \"tz\" (Olson) format, eg. \"America/Los_Angeles\".\n",
    "* **Type** - Type of the airport. Value \"airport\" for air terminals, \"station\" for train stations, \"port\" for ferry terminals and \"unknown\" if not known. In airports.csv, only type=airport is included.\n",
    "* **Source** - Source of this data. \"OurAirports\" for data sourced from OurAirports, \"Legacy\" for old data not matched to OurAirports (mostly DAFIF), \"User\" for unverified user contributions. In airports.csv, only source=OurAirports is included.\n",

    "The [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html) dataset also contains the ''Route database'' which provides information for 59036 routes between 3209 airports on 531 airlines spanning the globe. Each entry contains the following information:\n",
    "* **Airline** - 2-letter (IATA) or 3-letter (ICAO) code of the airline.\n",
    "* **Airline ID** - Unique OpenFlights identifier for airline (see Airline).\n",
    "* **Source airport** - 3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the source airport.\n",
    "* **Source airport ID** - Unique OpenFlights identifier for source airport (see Airport)\n",
    "* **Destination airport** - 3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the destination airport.\n",
    "* **Destination airport ID** - Unique OpenFlights identifier for destination airport (see Airport)\n",
    "* **Codeshare** - \"Y\" if this flight is a codeshare (that is, not operated by Airline, but another carrier), empty otherwise.\n",
    "* **Stops** - Number of stops on this flight (\"0\" for direct)\n",
    "* **Equipment** - 3-letter codes for plane type(s) generally used on this flight, separated by spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded. The special value \\N is used for \"NULL\" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.\n",
