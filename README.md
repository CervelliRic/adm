The repository contains support material for the lab classes of the [Algorithmic Methods for Data Science](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-ds-2015) course for
2015-2016 taught as part of the [Data Science master](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it) at [Sapienza University](http://www.uniroma1.it/).

# 3rd Lab

The 3rd lab focuses on Clustering data using the K-means algorithm. The material is based on the refcard from [DZone](https://dzone.com/) on [Practical Data Mining with Python](https://dzone.com/refcardz/data-mining-discovering-and).

We start using the [Iris Dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) that includes measurements on 150 [iris plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_%28plant%29). Each measurement includes:
* Sepal Length, 
* Sepal Width, 
* Petal Length and 
* Petal Width
