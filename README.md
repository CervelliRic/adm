The repository contains support material for the lab classes of the [Algorithmic Methods for Data Science](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-ds-2015) course for
2015-2016 taught as part of the [Data Science master](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it) at [Sapienza University](http://www.uniroma1.it/).

# 3rd Lab

The 3rd lab focuses on Clustering data using the K-means algorithm. The material is based on the refcard from [DZone](https://dzone.com/) on [Practical Data Mining with Python](https://dzone.com/refcardz/data-mining-discovering-and).

We start using the [Iris Dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) that includes measurements on 150 [iris plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_%28plant%29). We visualize the dataset using the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). 

We then continue with the [OpenFlights Dataset](http://openflights.org/data.html) and the airports tables that we used during the 2nd Lab.

The lab material is available as an iPython notebook:
* [Iris Dataset](/lab3/ADM%20Lab%203%20-%20Iris.ipynb)
* [Airports Dataset](/lab3/ADM%20Lab%203%20-%20Airports.ipynb).
